# Youtube-notifier
Python app to make up for functionality that Youtube used to have.

In August Youtube shut down functionality of sending notifications about videos to users.
My girlfriend really benefited from that one since she has many subscriptions, it's just waste of time to look through every channel to look for uploads,
not mentioning that not every channel is worth to check at all. And 'Subscriptions' tab of Youtube doesn't seem to her like pleasant to use.
I wanted to fix the problem for her, so here it is.
My own youtube notifier. Just put your credentials to respective variables and you can use it too.
I hope my comments are comprehensive and easy to understand.


IMPORTANT

Program won't work if user for which you run it has 2 channels with the same name. All subscribed channels must have unique names.
